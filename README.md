# Ising-model

These files form the basis of a 3rd year Monte-Carlo computational experiment to program and study the properties
of a 2D Ising model.

The files contain Python code templates that need to be completed and made functional.

The experiment was originally developed by Niall Jackson.
It was further developed by Aidan Chapman and Jonathan Hedley
